            <p> Growing up, every other month I would draw up new ways of rearranging my room, trying to figure out different ways my furniture would fit and different places to hang my decor. My mom hated it, but to me it was a puzzle that wanted to be solved. This carried out into my adult years and even now, my house gets rearranged more often than it probably should! </p>
            <p>Someone suggested trying my hand at coding to utilize my problem solving skills and creativity and the more I looked into it the more I was interested. I finally took the leap and signed up for a coding bootcamp and my love for coding was ignited! I have a passion for developing appealing and easy to use interfaces to meet the needs of many end users, whether that be education related (check out my Education Connection app listed below) or a way to connect with people who have the same interests as you. I admire the opportunity to contribute to the growth of technologies that help to make life easier and more enjoyable!</p>
